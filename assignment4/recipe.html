			<hr class="sen">

			1. Make the marinade. Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry powder, ground
			coriander,
			ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.

			<br>2. Marinate the chicken. Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts to the
			marinade,
			toss
			the
			chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for 30
			minutes. This
			chicken
			is honestly so flavorful and tender after just a 30 minute marinade, but if you want to make it
			earlier, you
			can
			leave the chicken in the marinade for up to 4 hours.

			<br>3. Skewer the chicken. If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes before
			preparing
			the
			skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill, pretty important stuff!
			Remove the
			chicken
			from the marinade and discard the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5 pieces of marinated chicken onto
			skewers.
			You’ll
			need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers.

			<br>4. Grill the chicken. Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly over high heat
			will
			give
			them
			a
			wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and tender in the middle! Place the skewers
			on the
			grill
			over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an additional 3-4 minutes. Remove from the grill
			and top
			with
			fresh cilantro, if you’d like.

		<div id="header2">What should I serve with it?</div>
		<div id="c1">
			<hl>Thai Peanut Sauce</hl>
			<br>– while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find
			chicken satay
			paired
			with
			peanut
			sauce. They really are a match made in heaven!
		</div>

		<div id="c2">
			<hl>Lettuce Leaves</hl>
			<br> – chicken satay is delicious served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a
			fork to
			remove
			the
			chicken
			from
			the skewers and place it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a
			little
			peanut
			sauce
			and
			you’ve got a light, healthy meal!
		</div>

		<div id="c3">
			<hl>Fresh Veggies</hl>
			<br>– as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a fresh
			veggie tray
			from
			Vons and
			extra
			Thai
			peanut sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken and veggie combo was light, yet still
			filling
			enough
			for a
			meal
			and it gave me the opportunity to dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut
			sauce!
		</div>

		<div id="c4">
			<hl>Stir Fried Veggies</hl>
			<br>– while the chicken is marinating, you can take that time to
			stir fry up
			your
			favorite
			veggies,
			like broccoli, bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.
		</div>

		<div id="c5">
			<hl>Asian Salad</hl>
			<br>– for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce
			section at
			your
			local
			Vons,
			to pair
			with the chicken skewers.
		</div>

		<div id="c6">
			<hl>Cooked Rice or Quinoa</hl>
			<br>– for a more filling side, serve the chicken satay with a
			side of
			cooked
			white rice,
			brown
			rice or quinoa.
