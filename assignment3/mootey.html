						4 Easy Steps to Satay Perfection!
						<br>
					</topic>

					1. Make the marinade. Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry powder, ground
					coriander,
					ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.

					<br>2. Marinate the chicken. Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts to the
					marinade,
					toss
					the
					chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for 30
					minutes. This
					chicken
					is honestly so flavorful and tender after just a 30 minute marinade, but if you want to make it
					earlier, you
					can
					leave the chicken in the marinade for up to 4 hours.

					<br>3. Skewer the chicken. If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30 minutes before
					preparing
					the
					skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill, pretty important stuff!
					Remove the
					chicken
					from the marinade and discard the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5 pieces of marinated chicken onto
					skewers.
					You’ll
					need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers.

					<br>4. Grill the chicken. Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly over high heat
					will
					give
					them
					a
					wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and tender in the middle! Place the skewers
					on the
					grill
					over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an additional 3-4 minutes. Remove from the grill
					and top
					with
					fresh cilantro, if you’d like.

						What should I serve with it?
						<br>
					</topic>

					<div class="flex-container2">
						<div>
							<hl>Thai Peanut Sauce</hl> – while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find
							chicken satay
							paired
							with
							peanut
							sauce. They really are a match made in heaven!
						</div>
						<div>
							<hl>Lettuce Leaves</hl> – chicken satay is delicious served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a
							fork to
							remove
							the
							chicken
							from
							the skewers and place it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a
							little
							peanut
							sauce
							and
							you’ve got a light, healthy meal!
						</div>

						<div>
							<hl>Fresh Veggies</hl> – as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a fresh
							veggie tray
							from
							Vons and
							extra
							Thai
							peanut sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken and veggie combo was light, yet still
							filling
							enough
							for a
							meal
							and it gave me the opportunity to dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut
							sauce!
						</div>

						<div>
							<hl>Stir Fried Veggies</hl> – while the chicken is marinating, you can take that time to
							stir fry up
							your
							favorite
							veggies,
							like broccoli, bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.
						</div>

						<div>
							<hl>Asian Salad</hl> – for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce
							section at
							your
							local
							Vons,
							to pair
							with the chicken skewers.
						</div>

						<div>
							<hl>Cooked Rice or Quinoa</hl> – for a more filling side, serve the chicken satay with a
							side of
							cooked
							white rice,
							brown
							rice or quinoa.
						</div>
